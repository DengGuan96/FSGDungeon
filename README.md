## Overview
FSGDungeon is a dungeon-crawling game project developed using C++ and C. The project is built using Microsoft Visual Studio and features a multi-platform setup, supporting both x86 and x64 architectures. The game likely involves procedurally generated dungeon levels where players can explore, battle enemies, and collect items.

## Project Structure
- **Debug/**: Contains debug-related files generated during the build process.
- **FushigiDungeon/**: This directory holds the core source code and project files.
- **FushigiDungeon.sln**: The solution file used by Visual Studio to manage the project and configurations.

## Prerequisites
